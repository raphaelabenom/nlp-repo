Abstract

We investigate if there are agreement and differences between the training intensity and load 
prescribed by the coach and those perceived by Amputee Soccer (AS) players. Eleven AS players 
and the team coach participated in the study. Before each session, we registered the coach Rating 
Perceived Exertion (RPE) intended (not disclosed to the players). Immediately after the training session, 
the players responded to the same version of RPE individually. The load was quantified through the 
session-RPE (s-RPE) (RPE x minutes). In sessions 1 and 2, the coach overestimated the training RPE 
(p < 0.05; Effect size [ES] = 0.2 and 0.3), whereas in sessions 4 and 5 the values were underestimated 
(p < 0.05; ES = 0.3). In the case of s-RPE, the overestimation of RPE occurred in session 1 (p = 0.02; ES 
= 0.9), whereas in sessions 4 and 5 (p < 0.05; ES = 1.8 and 0.9) the coach underestimated the load 
values. We conclude that the training load planned by the coach is different and disagrees with the 
perception of the AS players in most of the training sessions.

Introduction

Amputee  Soccer  (AS)  is  a  variation  of 
conventional  soccer  played  by  individuals  with 
a unilateral amputation of the lower limb (field 
players) and of the upper limb (goalkeeper)1. AS 
is characterized by explosive movements (jumping, 
kicking  and  changing  direction),  high  speed 
running, and support to muscle actions to keep the 
balance and control the ball against the opponent 
team2,  3.  AS  has  been  played  in  47  countries 
involving local, national, and international level 
championships. Hence, the level of demand and 
competitiveness has grown and directly impacts 
the sport training process.

Overall,  AS  training  takes  into  consideration 
technical,  tactical,  physical,  and  psychological 
aspects.  One  of  the  challenges  in  the  training 
process of team sports (e.g., AS), is monitoring the 
training loads and planning the sessions4. When 
prescribing a training load, coaches seek to calibrate 
the specific level of intensity to correspond to the 
adjustments they want to achieve5. Therefore, by 
adjusting  intensity  and  duration,  coaches  vary 
the training intensities avoiding scenarios such as 
undertraining or overtraining5. Briefly, coaches and 
sports physiologists need information that show the 
athletes’ adjustment to the training load and also 

 Rev Bras Educ Fís Esporte, (São Paulo) 2023;37:e37193026  •  1

their preparedness to receive the next load4.

Considering there are difficulties in quantifying 
fatigue  and  training  load  in  team  sports,  the 
rating of perceived exertion (RPE) has been used 
as  a  valid  measure  to  assess  the  intensity  of  the 
exercise5.  RPE  presents  a  number  of  benefits, 
including physiological and performance measures6. 
Additionally, the session RPE method (s-RPE) has 
been  applied  to  manage  the  prescribed  training 
load and evaluate how athletes perceive the training 
stimulus both currently and chronically7. Session-
RPE  involves  multiplying  the  perceived  training 
intensity (i.e., using an RPE scale) by the training 
duration  in  minutes7,  8. When  determining  the 
s-RPE, it is important that the rating refers to the 
full training session (e.g., not only the last minutes 
of the session). These pieces of information have 
to be considered by coaches to plan sessions with 
specific intensity and to manipulate training loads 
so as to adjust them to the specific training and/or 
competition periods.

The training process starts with a plan in which 
the  training  load  is  prescribed  and/or  expected 
by the coach. However, coaches may not be fully 
aware of the training load responses (e.g., s-RPE) 
from the players9. Indeed, studies have shown the 
difference between the RPE indicated by athletes 
and  that  planned  by  the  coach10.  Overall,  the 
coach's  predicted  intensity  (before  each  training 
session)  and  players'  RPE  (after  each  training 
session) is compared in those studies. When there 
is an agreement between the results it is expected 
that the difference between prescribed vs perceived 

load is zero. On the other hand, overestimation or 
underestimation of the training load occurs when 
there is a difference between the coach’s planned 
intensity  and  players'  responses.  In  individual 
sports, the relationship between the load prescribed 
and the one perceived are not consistent11. In team 
sports, due the fact that each player has different 
characteristics  and  thus  responds  differently  to 
the same training load5. Each player has different 
characteristics and thus responds differently to the 
same training load9. In general, the studies indicate 
multiple factors that may impact the association 
between coaches’ and athletes’ RPE. These factors 
are related with the sport, season and competition 
phase, match and/or training environment, exercise 
selection, training age, fitness and recovery status, 
coaching experience, and tool used10.

In the specific case of AS, there is a lack of information 
regarding the connection between the prescribed and 
the planned load, during the training sessions. Bearing 
in mind that AS players have obvious differences 
from non-disabled players (e.g., biomechanical and 
physiological aspects), it is necessary to understand 
the expectation of the coach and the real perception 
of the AS players. Therefore, we aim (1) to investigate 
if there is an agreement between the training intensity 
and load prescribed by the coach and those perceived 
by the players and (2) to test whether the intensity 
and training loads are different for the AS coach and 
the players. Since other sports show inconsistencies 
between the load planned by the coach and the load 
perceived by the athletes11-13, we hypothesized that this 
phenomenon also occurs in AS.

Methods

Participants 

Eleven  AS  male  players  (age  =  32±5.6  years; 
time of experience in AS = 41±17.0 months), with 
unilateral  lower  limb  amputation  (transfemoral, 
n = 7; transtibial, n = 2; and hip disarticulation, 
n  =  1),  participated  in  the  study.  All  players  are 
members of a team that participates in national and/
or international competitions and is affiliated to the 
Brazilian Association of Sports for the Physically 
Disabled - ABDF. We adopted the following inclusion 
criteria for the study: a) having at least six months 
of continuous training in AS (specific experience); 
b) being over 18 years old; c) being involved in AS 

competitions. The coach has 17 years of experience 
in the sport and has worked with different Brazilian 
clubs and with Brazil’s National team. He holds 
a Bachelor’s degree in Physical Education, and a 
Master’s and a Ph.D. in Physical Education and 
Sport Sciences.

The present study was approved by the local Ethics 
Committee (number 3.654.572). Initially, the goals 
and the procedures of the research were presented to 
the Board of the association involved. After the Board’s 
approval, the information regarding the study was 
presented to both the coach and the athletes. Their 
participation was voluntary and anonymous, and all 
the athletes signed the Informed Consent Form.

Experimental Design

The data collection occurred over six training 
sessions of the pre-competitive phase, aiming for the 
2019 Brazilian Championship of Amputee Soccer. 
Each session was planned by the same coach and lasted 
between 50 and 60 minutes. The participants were 
familiar with the scales and the anchorage procedure 
was not necessary. Before each session, we registered 
the coach’s intention regarding the RPE of the session 
and the Perceived Recovery Scale (PRS) from the 
players. The PRS was used for monitoring recovery 
and training readiness before the training sessions14. 
Immediately after concluding each training session, 
the players responded to the same version of RPE. All 
players reported their PRS and RPE individually to 
prevent peer bias. Also, the coach's intention regarding 
the intensity planned (i.e., coach's RPE before the 

session) was not disclosed to the players until the end 
of the experiment. FIGURE 1 shows the experimental 
design of the study.

Description of the training sessions

The training sessions followed specific guidance 
for AS training15 considering physical-technical-
tactical aspects in each session and the evolution 
with functional structures by small-sided games 
(SSG, TABLE 1). All the training sessions occurred 
at the same time of the day (8 pm) and also in the 
same field with artificial grass measuring 38 x 26 
m  (988  m2).  The  interval  between  the  sessions 
was 1 week. In sessions 1 and 3, two AS players 
did  not  finish  the  training  session  because  they 
had muscle pain or because their crutches broke 
during training.

SSG = small sided

Statistical Analysis

The normality of the data was verified using the 
Shapiro Wilk test. The RPE and PRS results did 
not indicate normal distribution of the data. These 
data are presented in median, confidence interval 
of the median (CI 95%), and absolute and relative 

frequency. The data related to sRPE presented 
normal distribution, the results being presented 
by  mean±standard  deviation  and  confidence 
interval (CI 95%).

The analysis of agreement between the coach and 
the players was performed by employing the Bland-
Altman  method16.  The  logistic  regression  model 

4  •  Rev Bras Educ Fís Esporte, (São Paulo) 2023;37:e37193026

(method: enter) was used to verify the relationships 
between  the  differences  in  the  RPE  and  s-RPE 
values  (variable:  dependent)  and  the  average  of 
these variables measures. To quantify the degree of 
relationship between the coach and the players, we 
used the Spearman Correlation test (ρ) for RPE and 
the Pearson Correlation (r) for s-RPE. 

To compare the RPE in the different training 
sessions,  the  Mann-Whitney  U Test  was  used, 
whereas  for  comparing  s-RPE,  we  used  the 
independent T Test.  We  considered  the  5% 
probability  of  type  I  error  (α)  to  identify  the 
differences. To calculate the effect size (ES, effect 
size)  for  the  non-parametric  data,  we  followed 

the Rosenthal recommendations, according to the 
equation: TE = Z /√N, where Z = z-score of the 
Mann-Whitney U test and N = the total number 
of the sample.

For  the  parametric  data,  we  used  the  ES 
calculated  from  the  average  difference  between 
the two groups dividing the result by the grouped 
standard  deviation  (Cohen  d).  Starting from the 
Cohen recommendations17, the ES was classified as 
small (< 0,2), moderate (0.3 – 0.5), large (0.6 – 0.8) 
and very large (> 0.8). We additionally calculated the 
values of percentage differences (∆%) between the 
s-RPE prescribed by the coach and that perceived 
by the athletes.

FIGURE 2 presents the Bland-Altmann graph for 
the RPE (FIGURE 2a) and s-RPE (FIGURE 2b)     
data.  The  agreement  bias  was  of  0.16±1.69        
(p = 0.480) and 13.0±94.0 (p = 0.303) for RPE 
and s-RPE, respectively. There were no statistical 
differences between the results, indicating that 
the values agree between them. We found weak/
negative correlation in RPE (ρ= -0.136; p = 0.319) 
and moderate/positive for s-RPE (r = 0.499; p < 
0.001). The results of the regression model indicated 
relationship bias in the results of RPE (β = -0.461; 
Standard error [SE] = 4.33; p = 0.292) and of 
s-RPE (β = 2.040; SE = 0.482; p < 0.001).

TABLE  2  presents  the  results  for  RPE-C 
and  RPE-AS  in  each  training  and  in  general. 
The  athletes  indicated  good  recovery  levels  to 
participate  in  the  training  sessions  (Median  = 
7; moderately recovered). We found differences 
between  the  players’  perception  and  that  of 
the  coach  in  training  sessions  1,  2,  4  and  5, 
with trivial and small ES (0.03 to 0.3). When 
analyzing the RPE descriptors, we identified that 
the coach always classified the training as “Very 
hard” (values between 7 and 9). The same result 
was found in the perception of most players 
(n = 40; 71.4%).

Discussion

Agreement between coach and AS player

The  Bland-Altman  analysis  did  not  indicate 
whether  the  agreement  is  sufficient  or  adequate. 
This analysis quantifies the bias and the range of 
agreement, within which 95% of the differences 
between the RPE and s-RPE are included18. The 
results of the Bland-Altman analysis indicate that 
the RPE and s-RPE values between the coach and 
the AS players converge. Observing the result's bias 
of  the  Bland-Altman  graph  (FIGURES  2a  and 
2b), we notice they are close to zero and they do 
not present significant differences. However, these 
results  should  be  cautiously  interpreted,  mainly 
because the complementary analyses performed in 
the study contradict the mentioned information18. 
Starting from the assumption that there may be 
differences in the results of the study, we also used 
the regression model to determine the agreement of 
the methods. Bland and Altman16 indicate the use 
of this procedure to assess the relationship between 
the bias and the magnitude of the measures. The 
results of our regression model indicated that for 
the systematic trends, the difference between the 
coach  and  the  AS  players  tends  to  increase  or 
decrease as the median of these values increases. In 
practical terms, our results indicate that the coach 
overestimates the intensity and underestimates the 
training load the players were exposed to.

Nevertheless, the magnitude of the relationship 
between  coach  and  AS  players  was  weak  and 
moderate  for  RPE  and  s-RPE,  respectively. We 
understand that the correlation coefficient does not 
represent agreement but rather reflects the noises 
and the direction of the relationship19. In our study, 
therefore, the correlation coefficient was treated as a 
linear measure for the relationship between variables 
without  providing  an  agreement.  Some  studies 
indicated a weak relationship between the intensity 
prescribed by coaches and the intensity perceived by 
swimming athletes20. When it comes to team sports, 
a  weak  agreement  between  the  planned  and  the 
perceived training intensity planned was observed 
in soccer21, futsal22 and volleyball12.

Comparison between coach and AS player

RPE  has  been  considered  a  valid  method  to 
monitor, to prescribe and to regulate the intensity 
of  the  exercise  and  to  assess  the  training  load 

(s-RPE). Here we compared the intensity and the 
load of the training planned (by the coach) and 
the intensity and load of training perceived by the 
AS players using both RPE and s-RPE. Our main 
findings indicated that in some training sessions, 
the intensity and load planned by the coach was 
different from those perceived by the athletes. We 
believe that such discrepancy (i.e., load planned was 
different from that perceived by AS players) is due 
to the coaches’ difficulty in planning and controlling 
the training load in team sports10.

Investigations on the relationship between the 
RPE of coaches (before the session) and athletes 
(after the session) are not recent in regular sports12, 
20, 21. The application of s-RPE to team  sports is 
promising, especially in Para-sports. In this area, 
the use of RPE has contributed to monitoring the 
training sessions and competitions23. For example, 
in wheelchair sports this method was already used to 
compare physiological responses among basketball 
players,  to  quantify  the  training  load  during 
games24 and to individualize the training load for 
wheelchair rugby elite athletes25. Especially for AS, 
two studies used RPE to measure the intensity in 
official  matches2,  3.  However,  as  far  as  we  know, 
this is the first study that has sought to compare 
the perceptions of both coach and AS players. In 
qualitative terms, our data revealed an agreement 
between  coach  and  players,  i.g.,  the  training 
sessions planned by the coach to be “Very hard” 
were considered  by the players as “Very hard”. On 
the other hand, in quantitative terms (i.e., s-RPE 
X minutes) our data showed differences between 
the training load planned (by the coach) and the 
observed (by the players).  For instance, we noticed 
that  the coach overestimated the training load in 
sessions  1  and  2,  while  the  athletes  presented  a 
lower training load for sessions 4 and 5. The main 
explanation for this discrepancy between qualitative 
vs. quantitative is the type of training performed 
(e.g., different demands from SSG).

AS is a complex game, of intermittent character, 
in which the players have to move with crutches 
and perform  technical skills  with their leg and/
or head3. As for conventional soccer, SSG games 
are usually aiming to reproduce the demands of 
the games and to train technical, tactical, physical-
physiological and psychological components26. In

technical limitations and increment of pressure) 
that  directly  influences  technical,  tactical, 
physiological  and  perceptual  aspects26.  Studies 
demonstrated that the different number of players 
causes  different  perceptive  characteristics27. 
Additionally,  the  use  of  structures  including 
numerical  advantage  (ex.:  3x2)  and  with  fewer 
participants (ex.: 1x1) cause greater RPE28.

Literature  has  indicated  that  RPE  has  a 
multifactorial nature, mediated by physiological 
and  psychological  factors6.  This  may  cause 
variability  between  coaches’  and  athletes’ 
perception.  In  the  current  study,  the  training 
sessions  in  which  the  coach  overestimated  the 
load were carried out  with ball control exercises, 
and SSG with numerical evenness to emphasize 
dribbling.  This  SSG  format  leads  to  high  levels 
of  exertion,  and  anaerobic  demand28  which 
partially  explains  the  coach’s  overestimation  of 
the load in the current study. The configuration 
of the exercises and activities in sessions 4 and 5 
involved  technical  aspects  (passing,  ball  control 
and shooting) and SSG 3x3, 4x4 configurations. 
In  SSG  with  3x3,  4x4  configurations  the  RPE 
is  generally  greater  than  in  other  formats26-28. 
Additionally, the game area occupied per player 
in  3x3,  4x4  configurations  is  smaller,  requiring 
that the players move with greater frequency to 
occupy the empty spaces in the field. These aspects 
may explain the differences found in the sessions 
when we compared the RPE and s-RPE planned 
by the coach with those perceived by the players.
A  crucial  point  to  explain  the  study  results 
is directly related to the perception of exertion. 
The experience of exertion involves detecting and 
interpreting the sensations that arise in the body 
during or immediately after the exercise6. From 
these  underlying  processes,  the  athletes  classify 
their momentary subjective perception of training 
based on physiological and psychosocial aspects, 
among others6. This does not happen when the 
coach estimates the athletes’ training load. RPE 
and s-RPE have several uses for monitoring the 
training  load,  but  do  not  provide  information 
about  an  individual  perception  of  the  physical 
exertion  of  a  training  session  to  be  conducted 
in  a  near  future29.  From  a  practical  viewpoint,  
discrepancies in load indication during training 
increase the risk of inadequate training10.

The  time  of  experience  with  the  context  of 
sports training may allow athletes and coaches to 
more easily identify the intensity levels of effort10. 

In our study, the AS players presented 3.4 years of 
experience in the sport. The team’s coach has 17 
years of experience in the sport. Those differences 
between the experience of the para-athletes and 
the coach (i.e., coach’s experience time is much 
longer than that of the players) can explain the 
discrepancy  in  the  perception  and  prescribed 
(quantitative)  training  load.  It  is  expected  that 
the experience of coaches and athletes will allow 
a better understanding of the athlete's perceptions 
of effort25. However, this fact was not observed in 
our study, mainly because the coach overestimated 
or underestimated the load of the training sessions.  
Although years of experience as a coach or athlete 
are often recognized as a testimony of expertise30, it 
seems that this may not provide a better indication 
of effort perception and prescription.

The  specific  points  for  understanding  the 
results of this study are focused on the individual 
characteristics  of  AS  players.  Particularly,  AS 
players  support  their  entire  body  mass  on  the 
crutches,  which  results  in  additional  fatigue 
patterns  (i.e.,  upper  limbs)  in  the  recruited 
muscles2, 3. The fatigue experienced by AS players 
can  be  more  evident,  as  crutches  deambulation  
consumes  10%  to  30%  more  energy,  resulting 
in  increased  energy  expenditure  and  physical 
exertion3. Therefore, it is crucial for AS coaches to 
know the specific demands of AS players (e.g., type 
of  displacement,  amputation  levels,  and  fatigue 
characteristics).  Indeed,  authors  point  out  that 
coach-athlete divergence can be mediated by the 
different demands of the sport. Para-sports coaches 
perform different tasks on a daily basis, mainly 
due  to  the  lack  of  resources  and  particularities 
of adapted sport30. The implementation of these 
additional  demands  affects  the  professional 
performance  of  the  coach  and  influences  his 
efficiency in the training prescription30.

Once individual responses to the training load 
are expected, the individualized approach is also 
important to assess whether the load perceived by 
the AS players is in accordance with that intended 
by the coach. In this sense, we confirmed our study 
hypothesis    (FIGURE  3).  In  other  words,  AS 
players reported different training loads than the 
coach. In practice, examining individual athlete 
responses  allows  the  coach  to  manage  which 
players are experiencing excessive fatigue and make 
necessary  adjustments  to  their  training  loads23. 
It  would  also  be  important  for  the  coaches  to 
futher investigate the reasons for excessive fatigue. 

 Rev Bras Educ Fís Esporte, (São Paulo) 2023;37:e37193026  •  9

For  example,  an  AS  player  with  a  transfemoral 
amputation can exhibit excessive levels of fatigue 
for 1 to 2 consecutive days because of the level of 
amputation, while an individual with transtibial 
amputation may respond differently3. Therefore, 
knowledge of individual load monitoring can be 
useful  to  ensure  that  the  applied  load  matches 
that  prescribed  by  the  coach5.  In  sum,  the 
divergence between the athletes’ and the coaches’ 
perceptions of effort during SSG has implications 
on the training program design. If coaches cannot 

accurately estimate the load of training, it will be 
difficult to plan training for the long term. 

Investigating only one team may have been a 
limitation of the current study, as different teams 
(i.e., coaches and players) may present different 
data. Future studies should investigate other load 
variables (e.g., heart rate, blood lactate, number 
of  sprints,  distances  covered  in  different  speed 
zones, etc) to contribute to better understanding 
between planned training load and responses from 
the AS players.

We conclude that the training load planned 
by the coach diverges from the perception of 
the AS players in most of the training sessions. 

The RPE scale did not prove to be adequate 
when  used  by  the  coach  for  the  intended 
training load.

This study was carried out with the financial support of the National Council for Scientific and 
Technological Development (CNPq) by process 432153/2018-7 (MCTIC/CNPq Nº 28/2018).

Resumo

Análise comparativa da percepção de treinadores e jogadores de futebol para amputados sobre a 
intensidade do treinamento.

Investigamos se existe concordância e diferenças entre a intensidade e carga de treinamento prescritas 
pelo treinador e percebidas por jogadores de futebol para amputados (FA). Onze jogadores de FA 
e o treinador da equipe participaram do estudo. Antes de cada sessão, registramos o a Percepção 
de Esforço planejada (não divulgado aos jogadores). Imediatamente após a sessão de treinamento, 
os jogadores responderam à versão da PSE individualmente. A carga foi quantificada por meio do 
método PSE da sessão (s-PSE, PSE x duração). Nas sessões 1 e 2, o treinador superestimou a PSE do 
treinamento (p < 0,05; tamanho do efeito [TE] = 0,2 e 0,3), enquanto nas sessões 4 e 5 os valores 
foram subestimados (p < 0,05; TE = 0,3). No caso do s-RPE, a superestimação ocorreu na sessão 1 (p 
= 0,02; ES = 0,9), enquanto nas sessões 4 e 5 (p < 0,05; ES = 1,8 e 0,9) o treinador subestimou a carga 
valores. Concluímos que a carga de treinamento planejada pelo treinador é diferente e discorda da 
percepção dos jogadores do FA na maioria dos treinos.
