ABSTRACT 
Plastic  waste  represents  a  major  environmental  concern,  as  it  does  not  degrade  in  the  environment  and  is 
constantly  discarded.  The  types  of  polymers  most  used  in  the  world  are  polyethylene  and  polypropylene, 
mainly for the production of packaging and, therefore, are the most discarded plastic waste in the environment. 
Some efforts are being applied to mitigate this situation, such as mechanical recycling, which transforms plastic 
waste into other products. But polymer cracking processes are promising alternatives, converting waste into 
lightweight materials that can be turned into commercial fuels. However, to be viable, these processes must 
consume as little resources as possible and, for this, feasibility experiments must be carried out to prove their 
application  on  a  large  scale  and  in  small  transformation  units.  This  work  presents  a  methodology  for 
assembling a low-cost pyrolysis reactor to carry out the cracking of polymeric residues, and experiments were 
carried  out  with  it,  whose  results  showed  the  technical  and  economic  viability  of  the  described  process, 
obtaining a rate of conversion of plastic into fuels of up to 96%, so it can be widely applied to reduce impacts 
caused by plastic disposal.

INTRODUCTION 

Plastic is increasingly present in homes and in the world economy, facilitating people's daily 

lives in various aspects, such as transporting groceries, storing food or manufacturing the most diverse 

products,  such  as  bags,  cups  or  straws.  These  polymeric  wastes  represent  serious  environmental 

problems,  as about  79% of plastic waste accumulates in  dumps, landfills, rivers and seas, causing 

various environmental, economic and social damages over time (GEYER, 2020; KAWAI; TASAKI, 

2015). 

In  addition,  polymers  represent  serious  problems  for  marine  fauna  through  microplastics, 

which originate from the slow decomposition of plastic waste. These materials are consumed by these 

animals  precisely  because  they  do  not  distinguish  them  from  their  natural  foods,  usually 

phytoplankton  and  zooplankton,  also  affecting  humans  (LESLIE  et  al.,  2022;  SARKER,  2011;

SRININGSIH et al., 2015). However, microplastics also affect the terrestrial environment, as they 

are used by industry for the production of cosmetics, paints, detergents, tires, etc. As a result, they 

affect  the  soil,  water  and  atmosphere,  while  contaminating  the  food  and  feed  production  chain 

(ALEXY et al., 2020; TOUSSAINT et al., 2019; ROY et al., 2022; WATT et al., 2021). 

The annual production of synthetic polymers has been increasing, with indications of almost 

doubling in just over 30 years (Fig. 1). As a result, the environmental problems caused by them will 

intensify more and more, reflecting the inappropriate disposal  of plastic  waste, the increase in  the 

world population and, consequently, the growing demand for plastic packaging.

These problems, caused by the inadequate disposal of plastic waste, mainly in countries that 

adopt consumerist practices, such as the United States and China (Fig. 2), lead to an increase in the 

need to promote recycling as an important practice inserted in the production chain of this material 

(LESKI; BERKOWICZ-PŁATEK, 2021).

In  this  context,  some  actions  are  planned  and  executed  to  try  to  mitigate  the  problem  of 

pollution caused by plastic waste, such as energy recovery, but it is very polluting, because during 

burning, many greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere. Alternatively, there is mechanical 

recycling, which reuses thermoplastics to produce new products, however, the plastic loses strength 

due to the constant repetition of the process, in addition, the types of polymers must be separated, 

increasing costs (EZE et al., 2021). 

 

With  the  emerging  need  for  the  development  of  alternative  energy  resources,  pyrolysis  or 

thermal cracking of polymers is being widely studied as a viable solution to reduce or minimize the 

environmental problems caused by the disposal of plastics (BAJUS; HÁJEKOVÁ, 2010; JIA, 2021). 

This  technique can be defined as a process  that, through heating and in  the absence or scarcity of 

oxygen, 

leads 

to 

the  decomposition  of  chemical  products,  whether  natural  or  organic 

(NOFENDRI, 2021). Thus, Sharuddin et al. (2016), explain this method as “the process of thermal 

degradation of long-chain polymer molecules into smaller and less complex molecules through heat 

and pressure”, whereas  Qureshi et al. (2020) state that “pyrolysis is  the thermal  decomposition or 

catalytic process of a material in an oxygen-free or oxygen-limited environment”, and describe the 

process as follows: “Polymer feedstock is introduced into a reactor at 450 – 600℃ to produce a steam. 

Vapors consist of condensable (liquid and wax) and non-condensable (gas) fractions”. 

For Barbarias (2019) and  Bezerra (2016) cracking has received a lot of attention and is  an 

excellent alternative to reuse discarded plastic waste. In this process, polymeric waste is converted 

into fuels or lighter chemicals that can be used as raw materials for the chemical and petrochemical

industries (ZHOU et al., 2021). In addition to generating products with greater added value, cracking 

has the advantage of being able to be carried out by mixing different types of plastics (SUNDARRAJ; 

MEIKANDAN, 2021). 

 

The polymeric cracking process can be carried out in two ways, thermal cracking, with high 

temperatures,  and  thermal  catalysis  cracking,  with  the  aid  of  catalyst  materials  to  accelerate  and 

improve the process and, therefore, improve the yield of the products obtained (VARGAS et al., 2021). 

Usually, catalyst materials are solid substances with acidic properties, such as zeolites, which when 

dehydrated,  develop  a  mesoporous  structure  with  ion  exchange  capacity  (VARGAS  et  al.,  2021; 

HERNÁNDEZ et al., 2005). However, other materials can be used, such as sodium carbonate, clays 

and silica, low-cost substances that can reduce the costs of the procedure  (BEZERRA et al., 2016; 

LESKI; BERKOWICZ-PŁATEK, 2021). As a result, plastic waste is basically converted into solid, 

liquid and gaseous fuels, thus obtaining products such as coal or coke, gases (mainly CO, CO2, CH4 

and H2) of high calorific value (between 15 and 30 MJ/m3) and oils that can be separated by other 

processes,  such  as  distillation,  in  order  to  obtain  diesel,  gasoline  or  other  types  of  residual  oils 

(RAJCA et al., 2020; THI et al., 2021; ZAJEMSKA et al., 2022). 

 

However, feasibility studies are needed that can develop methodologies and techniques for 

carrying  out  polymeric  cracking  at  viable  costs,  whether  for  small  or  large  transformation  plants, 

since large industrial pyrolysis reactors have a very high cost, around 300 to 500 thousand dollars per 

unit (ROGERS; BRAMMER, 2012; WOOLF et al., 2017). Therefore, this work aims to assemble a 

low-cost pyrolysis reactor for cracking mixed polyethylene and polypropylene polymers and, thus, 

evaluate  the  economic  viability  of  producing  fuels  compatible  with  gasoline  from  this  waste 

conversion system. 

With  the  use  of  low-cost  materials,  such  as  a  pressure  cooker,  camping  stove  and  other 

improvised materials, the pyrolysis reactor was assembled and tests were carried out in it that proved 

the effectiveness of the polymer catalytic pyrolysis procedure, when converting waste into fuel, with 

a rate of up to 96%, and a favorable energy expenditure ratio of 2.46:1.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

The selection of the necessary plastic waste of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) was 

carried  out  with  the  accumulation  of  materials  that  would  be  discarded.  To  identify  the  types  of 

polymers collected, the indicative symbols were used, printed on the plastic materials, according to 

the  standardization  of  recyclable  polymers  of  ABNT  NBR  13230  (Fig.  3).  Thus,  materials  that 

presented the corresponding symbols with numbers 2, 4 and 5 were collected.

The  polymeric  cracking  tests  were  performed  in  a  pyrolysis  reactor,  defined  by Ali  et  al. 

(2022), as “a sealed  chamber where a  chemical  reaction takes place [...]  in  which plastic waste is 

burned in the absence of oxygen”. The reactor was assembled following the model shown in Fig. 4a, 

with  low-cost  materials,  acquired  with  the  author's  own  resources,  in  order  to  prioritize  economic 

viability. The assembled equipment is shown in Fig. 4b.

The experiments were carried out with 200 g of mixed polymers, consisting of PE and PP, due 

to the volumetric capacity of the cracking unit, and the stove was lit for 45 minutes, adjusted to the 

intermediate position of the flame to avoid excessive energy consumption and to reach the highest 

temperature possible under these conditions. Thus, a test was carried out without a catalyst, while the 

pyrolysis tests by thermal catalysis were carried out with the addition of black clay powder, a type 

that is richer in aluminosilicates (LESKI; BERKOWICZ-PŁATEK, 2021), in the proportions of 5, 10, 

15 and 20% in relation to the mass of the raw material used. The best condition observed with the 

tests  was  repeated,  but  with  manual  control  of  the  flame  to  stabilize  the  temperature  around  250-

260 °C (Table 1), the temperature at which the beginning of the reactions in the cracking unit was 

observed in all the tests performed.

After  each  procedure  performed,  the  resulting  masses  of  liquid  and  solid  compounds  were 

measured on a precision scale of 1 g (Fig. 10), and the mass of gases was estimated, subtracting the 

liquid and solid masses from the total mass of polymers used, according to the formula: 

mG = mP - (mL+ mR) 

Where, 

mP = mass of polymers (raw material) 

mL = mass of liquid obtained 

mG = mass of gases obtained 

mR = mass of solid waste 

The compounds obtained from liquid fuel were properly transferred to suitable  flasks, with 

this,  the  tabulated  data  were  analyzed  to  verify  the  best  condition  in  which  the  cracking  of  the 

polymers occurred. This analysis was performed observing and evaluating the following criteria: 

01. 

Greater amount of liquid fuel collected; 

02. 

Lower energy expenditure, measured by comparing the mass of the LPG (liquefied petroleum 

gas) gas refill before and after the conclusion of each experiment; 

03. 

Greater amount of fuel, liquid and gas, generated; 

04.   Greater relationship between fuels produced and energy expenditure with LPG gas. 

A sample of the liquid compound obtained in the 3rd experiment, with the best results, was 

washed with distilled water to remove impurities and then passed through a simple distillation process 

to separate water residues and, mainly, other residual impurities. 

After  completing  the  purification  procedures,  a  sample  of  the  compound  was  submitted  to 

absorption  spectrophotometry  analysis,  using  the  WUV-M51  Web  Labor  spectrophotometer,  also 

performed on a commercial sample of pure common gasoline, obtained by adding and mixing 200 ml 

of  distilled  water  in  600  ml  of  regular  gasoline,  with  subsequent  decanting  and  draining  of  the 

aqueous/ethanol mixture, as according to Brazilian legislation, regular gasoline must contain  up to 

27.5% of anhydrous ethanol (BRASIL, 2014), thus obtaining 435 ml of pure gasoline. 

To  certify  the  results  obtained  by  the  analysis  by  spectrophotometry,  a  visible  light 

spectrometer was built (Fig. 5), by which it generates curves of the continuous spectrum of the fluid 

under analysis. Through it, it was possible to obtain the visible irradiation spectra of both commercial 

gasoline and pyrolysis oil and, thus, make a comparison between the two results, verifying similarities 

or discrepancies. For the construction of this equipment, the works of Feng et al. (2021) and Silva et

al. (2021) were used as a basis, which prove the effectiveness and precision of their respective projects 

comparing their results with those of commercial spectrometers. The optimization of the constructed 

device  was  carried  out  by  calibrating  the  position  and  distance  of  the  camera  in  relation  to  the 

spectrum generated by the diffraction grating, as well as adjusting the spectral curve in the Theremino 

Spectrometer  version  3.1  software.  These  procedures  were  performed  according  to  the  notes  of 

Gatkine et al. (2018), using green (532 nm) and red (645 nm) lasers.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

The  results  obtained  through  the  first  five  polymer  cracking  experiments  carried  out  were 

tabulated  and,  with  this,  it  was  possible  to  analyze  and  verify  the  most  favorable  conditions  for 

carrying out polymeric pyrolysis under the conditions described in this research. After identifying the 

best scenario among the pyrolysis experiments carried out, the conditions in which it occurred were 

repeated in the sixth test, with flame control to maintain temperatures around 250 °C, reaffirming the 

best results obtained in the third procedure (Table 2). However, to confirm the best scenario, six tests 

were carried out with different polymeric raw materials, which obtained different proportions of fuel 

and waste.

The analysis of the results allowed us to point out the third test, which received black clay as 

a  catalyst  at  a  rate  of  10%,  as  the  one  that  presented  the  best  fuel  production  and  high  polymer 

conversion rate, 96% of the polymeric mass, with the lowest relative energy expenditure, exceeding 

two parts of fuel obtained for each part of fuel consumed, thus presenting a ratio of 2.46:1 (byproduct: 

consumption). 

Using the data in this table, it was possible to build a comparative graph (Fig. 6), relating the 

production of fuel oil and gases, and the total amount of fuel produced in each of the experiments 

carried out,  according to the percentage of catalyst added. However, the sixth experiment  was not 

included, as it took place in different temperature conditions than the others.

From the graph it is possible to notice the increase in the production of liquid and gaseous 

fuels, as the catalyst material is added in up to 10% of the polymeric mass, at which time there is a 

reduction in the production of oils, in case of an increase in this percentage, however, gas production 

does  not  decrease.  It  is  also  verified  that  the  gaseous  production  becomes  more  intense  to  the 

detriment of the oil production, as the amount of the catalyst is increased.

To analyze the pyrolysis oil obtained in the third experiment, a 50 g sample of it was subjected 

to two purification procedures, washing and distillation. The first procedure, washing, was carried 

out with distilled water to avoid unwanted reactions between the fuel and the salts present in drinking 

and tap water. The process was repeated three times in the same sample, aiming at more efficiency. 

The water, with absorbed impurities, was separated from the oil by decanting (Fig. 7a), thus obtaining 

a lighter fuel than the original oil (Fig. 7b).

The distillation procedure was carried out by simple distillation, using the infrastructure of the 

pyrolysis reactor assembled, at temperatures below 100 °C, to separate the lighter compounds from 

the pyrolysis oil, in the gasoline condensation range. In this way, the washed oil was accommodated 

in  a glass  container (distillation  flask) and its lid was sealed and perforated for the  allocation and 

fixation of a copper tube, also sealed, and connected to a hose, with the same diameter as the pipe 

(¼ inch), also used as a coil for the condenser (Fig. 8a-8b).

Through the distillation process, two compounds were obtained, 30 g of a clean and clear fuel 

(Fig. 9a), resulting from the condensation of lighter gases; and 18 g of residue, with the consistency 

of dense and dark grease (Fig. 9b), remaining in the flask. The remainder of the prepared sample, 2 g 

of material, represents the removed impurities and non-condensable gases.

The analysis of the obtained compound was performed by comparing the spectrophotometry 

results of a sample of purified commercial gasoline, as a reference. The measurements took place in 

the visible light spectrum range, from 400 to 700 nm of electromagnetic wavelength, between 50 nm 

spaces,  with  three  repetitions  for  each  measurement.  From  the  data  of  these  measurements,  it  is 

possible to  observe the total absorbance of the radiation  up to  500 nm,  at which time it begins  to 

decrease, in a sinuous way, until it stabilizes in the range of 650 nm, with lower energy absorbance at 

700 nm (Fig. 10). 

 

The spectrophotometry analysis of the pyrolysis oil followed the same conditions and steps as 

those  performed  with  commercial  gasoline.  Thus,  from  the  information  acquired  through  the 

measurements, the behavior of the curve similar to that of commercial gasoline can be observed, with 

initial total absorbance, up to 450 nm, and then a drop in this aspect, until reaching 700 nm, the lowest 

absorbance point presented in the fuel (Fig. 11). However, in the electromagnetic range between 550 

and 600 nm, there is a slight deceleration in the drop-in absorbance, and then it returns to the rate of 

reduction, tending to reduce even more in the infrared spectrum.

By superimposing the curves of these two graphs (Fig. 12) it is possible to better verify the 

spectrophotometry similarity between analyzed compounds. It is observed, then, that the components 

presented in the electromagnetic range between 400 and 450 nm are the same for both the standard 

fuel, commercial gasoline, and the fuel obtained with polymeric cracking. Likewise, this occurs in 

the range of 585 nm, when the curves of the compounds intersect, indicating a common composition, 

as well as the tendency of the curves to meet again in the infrared spectrum, above 700 nm of  the 

spectrum of this radiation. In the segment between 450 and approximately 585 nm, the pyrolysis oil 

has lower energy absorption than the same range of standard gasoline, thus indicating the obtaining 

of lighter and less energetic fractions of fuels in this range of the spectrum. However, in the segment 

between  585  and  700  nm,  the  pyrolysis  compound  absorbs  more  energy  than  the  reference  fuel, 

obtaining, in this range, fractions of heavier components and, therefore, more energetic components 

of this fuel.

In order to validate the results obtained with the spectrophotometry analysis, a spectrometry 

study was also carried out, using the device set  up for this purpose, on samples of distilled water,

purified commercial gasoline and pyrolysis oil obtained (Fig. 13). Thus, aiming at a more consistent 

analysis, the visible light spectrum of the distilled water sample was initially obtained (Fig. 14), which 

served as a parameter to generate the spectra of the fuel compounds to be compared.

After calibrating the spectrometer, using distilled water, the spectra of the fuels under analysis 

were obtained. Thus, it can be observed in the spectrum of purified commercial gasoline (Fig. 15) a 

greater intensity in the ranges between 650 and 700 nm, corresponding to red light, and between 400 

and 415 nm, consistent with violet light. In the other parts of the spectrum, greater absorption of green 

light  is  observed, between 500 and 540 nm.  Compared to  the gasoline spectrum, the pyrolysis oil 

spectrum  (Fig.  16)  presents  very  similar  behavior  and  characteristics,  with  bands  close  to  higher 

intensities and higher radiation absorptions in relation to the analyzed gasoline spectrum.

With the superposition of the spectra of gasoline and pyrolysis oil (Fig. 17), the similarities 

between the visible radiation spectra of the two compounds can be seen more clearly, especially in 

the  range  from  460  to  540  nm.  In  this  interval,  a  profound  similarity  between  the  spectra  can  be 

verified,  indicating  compatible  compounds  in  the  two  analyzed  fuels.  However,  there  are  small 

differences in the other parts of the spectra, with pyrolysis oil showing a little more energy absorption, 

thus  indicating  that  it  is  a  slightly  heavier  and  more  energetic  compound,  compared  to  gasoline. 

However,  even  with  these  discrepancies,  the  overlay  of  the  graphs  presents  similar  behaviors, 

indicating similar compositions, even in the divergent bands.

CONCLUSION 

In view of the results presented, it was found that the objectives of this research were fully 

met, however, some reservations must be pointed out. In this sense, it was observed that the prototype 

of  the  assembled  pyrolysis  reactor,  despite  being  efficient  and  suitable  for  the  proposal  presented 

here,  can  be  improved  and  have  its  costs  even  lower,  replacing  the  aluminum  pressure  cooker,  a 

relatively  fragile  material  at  high  temperatures,  by  a  paint  can,  made  of  steel  and  more  resistant, 

without the need for sealing with a rubber ring. It was also observed that the condenser coil did not 

necessarily need to be made of a copper tube, and could be assembled with a plastic or rubber hose, 

since the high temperatures occur only inside the cracking unit and the condenser must be immersed 

in water at low temperatures. 

Both the thermal variation and the variation of proportions added of black clay as catalyzed 

in the catalytic cracking process of polymers exerted influences on the quantities and characteristics 

of the by-products obtained in the experiments carried out, however, the process without the use of 

the catalyst did not obtain satisfactory results. Thus, even with the efficiency verified in the thermal 

insulation system, temperatures below 300 °C are not indicated for carrying out polymeric pyrolysis, 

at the cost of sacrificing the efficiency of the system and the return on fuels obtained. 

After  the  spectroscopic  analysis  of  the  sample  of  the  liquid  compounds  obtained,  in 

comparison with the same analysis performed on commercial gasoline, similarities were verified in 

the spectral curves and, therefore, in their respective compositions, thus pointing to gasoline as one 

of the compounds acquired with the catalytic cracking process. However, more definitive analyzes 

and  tests  can  be  performed  for  a  more  accurate  identification  of  the  polymeric  pyrolysis  fuel 

composition. 

Thus, it is concluded that the thermal catalysis cracking procedure presented in this study is 

feasible  for  its  implementation  on  any  scale,  from  a  small  reactor,  as  presented  here,  to  a  large 

commercial reactor. This feasibility was observed in relation to the economic aspect, since the model 

of the reactor suggested and assembled aims at the low cost of its construction and the materials used 

in it. In addition, the energy consumption observed in the best scenario among the tests carried out, 

confirms the aforementioned economic feasibility, since the relationship between the amount of fuels 

acquired with the pyrolysis process and the fuels consumed is very favorable for the pyrolysis oil, 

thus indicating that the energy expenditure is compensated by the procedure performed.
